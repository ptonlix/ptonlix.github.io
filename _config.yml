          💯 Perfecting AI workflows with human intelligence
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          GoHumanLoop：是一个Python库，使AI Agent能够在关键阶段动态请求人类输入（批准/反馈/对话）。我做这个项目是为了让AI Agent与人更好协同工作，确保Agent始终与人类对齐，提供更安全、更可靠的AI服务。

          Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
